    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.
      You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to
      go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C),
        and lightly grease a pizza pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until
        creamy, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You
        can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to
        make it easier.
